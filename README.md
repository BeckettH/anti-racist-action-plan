# DO SOMETHING
As a white person who is has a strong value for being anti-racist, I often struggle with taking concrete action.

This happens for many reasons, including feeling stuck as to what I can offer, feeling shame that I haven't done more already, feeling overwhelmed by long lists of possible things I could do, and being limited by disabilities or lack of practical resources.

I built this tool for myself, with the hope that other white people will also find it helpful for getting over the barriers to taking action.
